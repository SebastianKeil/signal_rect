# signal_rect

signal_rect is a small JavaScript app that shows how sinewaves can add together and create a rectangular wave.
Set the **slider** to create more sinewaves which add together, so the rectangular wave is more acurate.
This is how most functiongenerators work.
It uses the p5.js library and is inspired by Daniel Shiffman.
